"""Build data/cached_jobs.json — the committed offline jobs dataset.

This snapshot is the app's offline fallback AND a test fixture, so it ships in
the repo. It is assembled from live sources:

  - Adzuna across several countries (us, gb, de, in, au) — needs free API keys.
    Provides the international coverage. Skipped automatically if keys are unset.
  - Remotive (keyless) — worldwide remote roles, so offline mode still returns
    remote jobs even for a reader with zero keys.

Run:  uv run python scripts/snapshot_jobs.py
With no Adzuna keys you still get a real remote-jobs cache; re-run after adding
ADZUNA_APP_ID / ADZUNA_APP_KEY to enrich it with country-specific postings.
