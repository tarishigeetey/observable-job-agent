"""Extract a structured candidate profile from CV text.

This is a preprocessing step that runs *before* the job-finding graph: the graph
takes the resulting ``Profile`` as input and focuses on searching and ranking
jobs. Keeping extraction out of the graph keeps the graph about one thing —
finding jobs — and lets a caller (like the UI) extract once and reuse it.
