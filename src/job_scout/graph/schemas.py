"""Pydantic models used across the agent graph.

These are the structured-output targets for the LLM/tool calls and the shared
data contracts the nodes read and write.

Phase 2 note: the Phase 1 ``TailoringPack`` stub (a flat "emphasis brief") was
replaced by the corpus-grounded v2 models below. That is a breaking change to
the checkpoint format, and it is safe only because the sole checkpointer is an
in-process ``MemorySaver``: no checkpoint survives a restart and no Phase 1
code path ever wrote ``tailoring`` into a thread. With a persistent
checkpointer (e.g. Postgres) this would have required a real migration.
